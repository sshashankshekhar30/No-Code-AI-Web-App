# No-Code AI Web App — Full Build Guide

**Goal:** Build a production-ready, dynamic, responsive, AI-driven web application you can sell — using no-code tools. This guide gives you *everything*: account setup, UI fields, exact workflows in Bubble, visual automation steps in Make (Integromat), Pinecone vector DB wiring, OpenAI prompt templates, Stripe billing setup, testing and launch checklist.

---

## Summary (one-line)

Make a Bubble app (UI + auth + uploads) → use Make to orchestrate file text extraction, embeddings, Pinecone lookups and OpenAI chat → use Stripe (via Bubble plugin) for billing → add monitoring, moderation and safety → launch.

---

## Tech stack (recommended, production-ready)

* **Frontend & app builder:** Bubble.io (responsive, user auth, file upload, plugins)
* **Automation / orchestration:** Make.com (visual flows, connectors for OpenAI, Pinecone, Google Calendar, email)
* **AI model provider:** OpenAI (GPT-4o/GPT-4.x / embeddings)
* **Vector DB (memory / RAG):** Pinecone
* **Payments:** Stripe (or Paddle for MOReasy global taxes)
* **File extraction (PDF->text):** Make built-in module or a small no-code extractor (PDF.co, CloudConvert) via Make
* **Monitoring & analytics:** Sentry/Logflare + Google Analytics / Mixpanel

> Notes: You can substitute Xano for backend or Voiceflow for agentic flows. This guide uses Bubble + Make as the canonical no-code path.

---

## Accounts to create (minimum)

1. Bubble.io (Editor + paid plan when you go live)
2. Make.com (free tier for prototyping, paid for production runs)
3. OpenAI account (API keys) — ensure billing set up
4. Pinecone account (API keys) — create project & index
5. Stripe account (test & live keys)
6. Optional: PDF.co / CloudConvert for PDF to text

Store API keys securely (Bubble server-side or Make environment variables).

# Step-by-step build (detailed)

## 1) Design product + data model

Pick 1 core job. Example chosen for this guide: **AI Document Assistant** (upload PDFs, ask questions, get summaries/export briefs).

Data model in Bubble (create Data Types):

* **User** (built-in)
* **Document**: fields: `owner (User)`, `file_url (file)`, `title (text)`, `status (text: pending/processed)`, `created_at`
* **DocChunk**: `document (Document)`, `chunk_text (text)`, `embedding_id (text)`, `vector_meta (text)`
* **Conversation**: `user (User)`, `messages (list of Message)`
* **Message**: `sender (text: user/assistant)`, `text (text)`, `created_at`

Keep names exact — later you will reference them in Bubble workflows.

---

## 2) Build Bubble UI (pages & elements)

**Pages:**

* `index` (marketing, sign up CTA)
* `signup` (optional if using Bubble auth modal)
* `dashboard` (list of documents, upload button)
* `document` (view document, chat with assistant)

**Key UI elements on `dashboard`:**

* RepeatingGroup `RG_Documents` showing `Document` entries for `Current User`
* FileUploader `FU_Document` (accept PDFs)
* Button `BTN_Upload` (triggers workflow sending file to Make)

**Key UI elements on `document` page:**

* Text `DocumentTitle`
* Chat repeating group `RG_Chat` (source = Messages for this Conversation)
* Input multiline `INP_UserMessage`
* Button `BTN_SendMessage`
* Button `BTN_Summarize` (request auto-summary)
* Button `BTN_ExportPDF` (export brief — gated behind subscription)

**Responsive:** Use Bubble responsive editor: group elements into rows/columns, hide heavy elements on narrow widths if necessary.

---

## 3) Create Make scenarios (core automation)

You will create 3 core scenarios:

### Scenario A — File processing pipeline (triggered by Bubble webhook)

**Trigger:** Webhook receives POST from Bubble with `file_url`, `document_id`, `user_id`, `title`.

**Steps (Make modules):**

1. **HTTP Get** the file from `file_url` (if private, use Bubble temporary URL or send file bytes)
2. **PDF to Text** (PDF.co or CloudConvert module) → get full raw text
3. **Text cleaning & chunking** (Make has text aggregator & iterator modules). Split into \~500 token chunks (\~300–800 words depending)
4. **OpenAI Embeddings** (call embeddings endpoint for each chunk) → store vector + metadata
5. **Pinecone Upsert**: upsert vectors into your index (namespace = `user_id` or `document_id`) — include metadata: `document_id`, `chunk_index`, `chunk_text[0:300]` (small snippet for debugging)
6. **Make → Bubble API**: send callback to Bubble to mark `Document.status` = `processed` and create `DocChunk` records if you want to mirror them in Bubble

**Important settings:**

* Use batching for Pinecone upserts (e.g., 50 vectors per upsert) to be efficient
* Store the vector id returned by Pinecone (or build your own id using `documentid_chunkidx`)

### Scenario B — Question answering / Chat

**Trigger:** Bubble webhook when user sends a message (includes `user_id`, `document_id`, `user_message`, `conversation_id`)

**Steps:**

1. **OpenAI Embeddings** on `user_message` → embedding vector
2. **Pinecone Query** (top\_k=5) with embedding in `namespace=document_id` (or user namespace) → returns top chunks with metadata and similarity scores
3. **Build prompt template**: prepend system prompt + retrieved chunks (concise) + user message

**Prompt template (short):**

```
System: You are a helpful assistant that answers questions only using the provided context. If the answer is not in the context, say: "I couldn't find that in the documents. Would you like me to search the web?"

Context:
1) {chunk1}
2) {chunk2}
...
User: {user_message}
Assistant:
```

4. **OpenAI Chat API** call (gpt-4o or gpt-4.1) with streaming turned off — pass assembled messages
5. **Moderation step** (optional but recommended): Call OpenAI moderation endpoint with assistant response before returning
6. **Return to Bubble** webhook with answer text → Bubble app displays message
7. **Optional:** Save conversation/message records in Bubble via API call

### Scenario C — Agentic actions (Calendar, Email, Export)

**Use case examples:** "Schedule a meeting" or "Send this summary by email".

**Flow pattern:**

1. Bubble sends user intent + message to Make
2. Make runs QA step: get top 3 retrieved context and ask LLM to output an action JSON (function-call like) e.g.,

```json
{"action":"create_calendar_event","title":"Meeting about contract","start":"2025-09-20T10:00:00+05:30","attendees":["a@example.com"]}
```

3. Make reads JSON and runs corresponding module: Google Calendar create event / Gmail send email / Stripe action
4. Ask user for confirmation (Bubble UI shows proposed action; user must click Confirm)
5. If confirmed, run action and send back success message

**Security:** Always require explicit user confirmation for any transactional action.

---

## 4) Pinecone setup (keys, index, schema)

* Create a Pinecone project, note API key & environment
* Create an index (suitable dimension matching your embedding model; e.g., OpenAI ada-002 embeddings = 1536; newer embedding dims depend on model) — call it `docs-index`
* Use namespaces per user or per document to isolate data: `namespace=user_{user_id}` or `namespace=document_{doc_id}`
* Metadata stored with each vector: `{document_id, chunk_index, source_url, snippet}`

**Best practice:** Use a limited TTL for temporary caches or implement deletion endpoints for GDPR compliance.

---

## 5) OpenAI config & prompts

**API keys:** Use Make environment variables to store keys

**Embedding model:** `text-embedding-3-large` (or model recommended by OpenAI at the time)
**Chat model:** `gpt-4o-mini` or `gpt-4.1` (depending on cost/latency)

**System prompt (for doc QA):**

```
You are a safe, helpful assistant strictly limited to the content given in the "Context" below. Answer concisely and cite the chunk numbers you used. If the information is not present, say: "I couldn't find that in the documents." Do not hallucinate.
```

**Prompt assembly rules:**

* Include only top-k chunks (k=3..6), sorted by similarity
* Truncate long chunks to \~600 tokens in total context
* Add user instruction: "Answer in simple language. Provide a short summary and detailed bullets."

**Agentic function-call template (for Make parsing):**

```
Return only JSON with fields: {"action": "<name>", "params": {...}}. If no action needed, return {"action":"none","response":"<text>"}
```

---

## 6) Bubble API Connector config (if not using prebuilt plugin)

When Bubble calls Make webhooks or when Bubble calls OpenAI directly (smaller flows), use the API Connector plugin.

**Example OpenAI Chat API POST config:**

* URL: `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`
* Headers: `Authorization: Bearer <OPENAI_KEY>`, `Content-Type: application/json`
* Body (JSON):

```
{
  "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
  "messages": [ {"role":"system","content":"<system prompt>"}, {"role":"user","content":"<user prompt>"} ],
  "max_tokens": 800,
  "temperature": 0.2
}
```

Use server-side actions in Bubble to keep API keys hidden.

---

## 7) Stripe integration & gating

* In Bubble: install Stripe plugin (official). Use Stripe Test keys first.
* Create product plans in Stripe Dashboard: `free`, `pro_monthly`, `pro_yearly`.
* Workflow: On `Upgrade` button → run plugin action `Start Stripe Checkout` (pass plan id) → on success, Stripe redirects to your success page. Then bubble workflow updates `User` role/field `is_pro = yes`.
* Gate features in Bubble: Condition elements or workflows to `Current User's is_pro is yes` for upload/export.

**Trials:** Use Stripe coupons or set trial days in subscription checkout.

---

## 8) Safety, moderation, and cost control

* **Moderation:** Send user inputs to OpenAI moderation endpoint and block/flag content if policy triggers
* **Quotas:** Track number of tokens/embedding calls per user in Bubble (increment counters in workflows). Automatically disable heavy features for free users to prevent bill shock
* **Logging:** Send copies of AI responses & actions to your logging store (Sentry/Logflare) for audits

---

## 9) Testing & QA

* Use sandbox keys for Stripe, Pinecone, OpenAI
* Create test users with different roles
* Test edge cases: huge PDFs, ambiguous questions, malicious inputs
* Test agentic flows: schedule events, send emails — ensure confirmations

---

## 10) Deployment & going live

* Upgrade Bubble plan for custom domain & performance
* Use Make production plan for needed operations per month
* Switch API keys to live mode (OpenAI production key, Stripe live keys)
* Set rate-limits & caching (Cloudflare) if you expect high traffic

---

## 11) Monitoring & analytics

* Add Google Analytics and Mixpanel for usage funnels
* Add error logging (Sentry). In no-code, log key failures via Make → HTTP post to Sentry
* Add cost dashboard: Save rough token counts per request and approximate cost = tokens \* unit\_price. Alert if daily cost > X.

---

## 12) Pricing & go-to-market

* Offer free tier with limited uploads / limited monthly queries
* Offer 2 paid tiers: Basic (5 uploads/month) & Pro (unlimited or higher limits) with team plan
* Launch channels: Product Hunt, LinkedIn, Reddit, Telegram/WhatsApp communities and niche forums

---

## 13) File export & legal

* Export feature: assemble AI summary into HTML → convert to PDF using Bubble's PDF generator or Make PDF.co. Protect behind paywall
* Privacy & TOS: draft a short privacy policy telling users what data is sent to OpenAI and how long you retain it

---

## 14) Costs & rough estimate (monthly)

* Bubble: \$29–129+ (app plan) depending on traffic
* Make: \$9–99+ depending on operations
* OpenAI: depends on tokens; estimate \$50–\$500 first months depending on usage
* Pinecone: \$10–100+ depending on storage and queries
* Stripe: transaction fees only

Plan for \$200–\$1000/month early.

---

## 15) Complete checklist (do this in order)

1. Finalize idea & 1-line value prop
2. Create accounts (Bubble, Make, OpenAI, Pinecone, Stripe)
3. Build Bubble pages & data types (as above)
4. Create Make scenarios A (file processing) & B (chat) & C (agentic) and test with sample PDF and test user
5. Connect Pinecone & OpenAI to Make, test embeddings & queries
6. Add Stripe in Bubble, make gating logic
7. Add moderation & rate limits
8. Run closed beta with 10–50 users
9. Fix issues, prepare marketing pages & pricing
10. Go live, monitor costs, iterate

---

## Example prompt templates (copy-paste)

**System prompt (doc assistant):**

```
You are a helpful assistant restricted to the content in the Context. Always reference which chunk number you used. If unsure, say you can't find the answer. Keep answers under 300 words unless asked for more. Use simple language.
```

**User to Agent template:**

```
User: {question}
Context:
1) {top_chunk_1}
2) {top_chunk_2}
...
Answer:
```

**Agent action JSON template (for agentic flows):**

```
If you need to perform an action return only JSON in exact format:
{ "action": "<action_name>", "params": { ... } }
If no action needed, return:
{ "action": "none", "response": "<assistant text>" }
```

---

## Troubleshooting & tips

* If responses hallucinate, reduce temperature and include more retrieved context
* If Pinecone returns poor matches, increase chunk overlap or retrain chunk size
* For speed, precompute embeddings at upload time (do not embed on-demand every query)
* Use namespaces to isolate user data and make deletions easier

---

## Next steps I can do for you (pick one)

* Provide a **lengthy, exact Bubble workflow export** (manual step-by-step for each workflow action with names) ready to paste into your Bubble editor as instructions
* Produce the **Make scenario blueprints** listing exact modules and their settings (so you can click & configure quickly)
* Create a **landing page copy + pricing table + Product Hunt template** for launch

---

*End of guide — you can copy this doc as a checklist and implement step-by-step. If you want, I will now create the exact Bubble workflows and Make scenario steps in the same format (very detailed) so you can copy and configure element-by-element.*
